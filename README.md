# ureca_repo
This repository consists of all the files that were created for my Summer 2022 URECA project at Stony Brook University. The purpose of the project was to understand how Jupiter collisions around a central star can be modeled and analyzed. The "Jupiters" were represented by polytropes and the central star was a sink particle.
